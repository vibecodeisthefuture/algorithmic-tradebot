# Research Stage: The Foundation of Algorithmic Trading

## Overview

The **Research** stage is the critical foundation of the RBI (Research, Backtest, Implementation) approach to algorithmic trading. This phase determines the quality and viability of your trading strategies before any capital is deployed. Thorough research separates profitable systematic trading from random speculation.

## What is the Research Stage?

Research in algorithmic trading is a systematic process of:

1. **Studying Proven Trading Strategies** - Understanding what has worked historically and why
2. **Analyzing Market Behaviors** - Identifying patterns, cycles, and regime changes in financial markets
3. **Evaluating Profitability Across Market Conditions** - Determining which approaches work in trending, ranging, volatile, and calm markets
4. **Building Solid Hypotheses** - Formulating testable ideas based on sound logic and empirical evidence

The goal is to develop a **robust trading hypothesis** grounded in research rather than hunches or anecdotal success stories.

## Why Research Matters

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Without proper research, you're building on sand. The research stage protects you from:
> - **Curve-fitting**: Creating strategies that work perfectly on past data but fail in live trading
> - **Bias**: Confirmation bias, survivorship bias, and look-ahead bias
> - **Ignorance**: Missing critical market dynamics that invalidate your approach
> - **Wasted Resources**: Spending time backtesting fundamentally flawed ideas

Quality research identifies:
- ✅ **Market inefficiencies** that can be exploited
- ✅ **Risk factors** that must be managed
- ✅ **Trading regimes** where strategies perform differently
- ✅ **Transaction costs** that may eliminate theoretical profits
- ✅ **Capacity constraints** that limit strategy scalability

---

## The Research Process

### 1. Define Your Research Questions

Start with specific, answerable questions:

- What market conditions favor mean-reversion vs. trend-following?
- How do different volatility regimes affect strategy performance?
- What time horizons show the strongest momentum effects?
- How do transaction costs impact short-term versus long-term strategies?
- What indicators have genuine predictive power versus data-mined correlations?

### 2. Gather Knowledge from Authoritative Sources

Research is a knowledge-building exercise. Use multiple authoritative repositories to develop a comprehensive understanding.

### 3. Document Your Findings

Maintain a research journal documenting:
- Key insights from each source
- Strategy ideas worth testing
- Market behaviors you've identified
- Questions that need further investigation
- References to source materials

### 4. Formulate Testable Hypotheses

Transform insights into specific, testable hypotheses:

- ❌ **Weak**: "Momentum strategies make money"
- ✅ **Strong**: "12-month price momentum in the top quintile of stocks, rebalanced monthly, outperforms the market after adjusting for market beta and size factors"

---

## Authoritative Research Resources

---

## Key Principles for Effective Research

### 1. **Seek Disconfirming Evidence**

Don't just look for sources that confirm your ideas. Actively seek research that challenges your hypotheses. This prevents confirmation bias.

### 2. **Understand the Why, Not Just the What**

Don't just note that "momentum works." Understand *why* it works:
- Behavioral finance explanations (underreaction, herding)
- Risk-based explanations (momentum compensates for specific risks)
- Market structure explanations (limit to arbitrage)

### 3. **Be Skeptical of Complexity**

Complex strategies aren't necessarily better. Simple, robust strategies often outperform elaborate curve-fit systems.

### 4. **Consider Transaction Costs**

Many academic strategies ignore real-world costs. Always factor in:
- Commissions
- Slippage
- Spread costs
- Market impact
- Opportunity costs

### 5. **Think About Capacity**

A strategy that works with $10,000 might fail with $10,000,000 due to liquidity constraints.

### 6. **Study Failures**

Learn as much from failed strategies as successful ones. Understanding why something doesn't work prevents wasted backtesting time.

### 7. **Document Everything**

Your research is only valuable if you can reference it later. Maintain organized notes with:
- Source citations
- Key findings
- Strategy ideas
- Questions for further research

## Red Flags in Research

> [!CAUTION]
> Be wary of:
> - **Unrealistic claims**: "95% win rate" or "guaranteed profits"
> - **Cherry-picked results**: Only showing best-performing periods
> - **Lack of methodology**: No explanation of how results were achieved
> - **Survivorship bias**: Only analyzing surviving companies/funds
> - **Data mining**: Testing hundreds of parameters to find what worked in the past
> - **No risk discussion**: Focusing only on returns without addressing drawdowns

---

## Research Deliverables

At the end of your research phase, you should have:

1. ✅ **Research Journal**: Documented insights from books, papers, and media
2. ✅ **Strategy Hypotheses**: 3-5 specific, testable strategy ideas with clear logic
3. ✅ **Reference Library**: Organized collection of papers, book notes, and resources
4. ✅ **Market Understanding**: Deep knowledge of how your target markets behave
5. ✅ **Backtest Plan**: Clear methodology for testing hypotheses (setting up the Backtest stage)

---

## Transitioning to Backtest Stage

Research doesn't end when you start backtesting. It's an iterative process:

```
Research → Backtest → Discover Issues → More Research → Refine Backtest → ...
```

Good research produces:
- **Testable hypotheses** ready for empirical validation
- **Parameter ranges** based on theory, not arbitrary choices
- **Expected behavior** that allows you to identify bugs and errors
- **Understanding** that helps interpret backtest results correctly

---

## Final Thoughts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Research is the highest-leverage activity in algorithmic trading.** Hours spent in research save weeks of backtesting flawed ideas and prevent deploying capital on fundamentally broken strategies.

The sources listed in this guide represent decades of trading wisdom. Use them not to copy strategies directly, but to:
- Build mental models of how markets work
- Understand what separates signal from noise
- Develop critical thinking about trading claims
- Generate original ideas grounded in sound principles

**The goal of research isn't to find "the perfect strategy"—it's to develop the understanding necessary to create, evaluate, and improve strategies systematically.**

Your research quality directly determines your trading success. Invest the time. Do the work. Build the foundation.
